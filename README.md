# IAQ-Core
[The IAQ-core Indoor Air Quality Module](https://www.tindie.com/products/novemberfive/iaq-core-sensor-module/) is a low-cost, ultra-compact solution for detecting poor air quality. This module uses micromachined metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) technology to detect a broad range of VOCs while correlating directly with CO2 and TVOC levels in the room.

## Features

- Measure VOC levels 
- Provide CO2- and TVOC equivalent predictions
- Data is available via I2C bus
- The sensor itself is protected by a plastic cap and a filter membrane
- Pull-up resistors are present on the board
- 4 mounting holes allow this breakout to be easily embedded into a project
- Supply Voltage 3.3V
- Board provides a place for connecting rows of 3 pin headers
- Breadboard friendly
- 35.2 x 25.4 mm

Note: Please read the I2C addressing instructions carefully. An undefined use of the I2C interface could harm the iAQ-Core module and cause a loss of functionality.

## Note
Choose between IAQ-Core C and - P (continuous & pulsed). 
- pulsed has 9mW power consumption and a measurement interval of 11s. (max).
- continuous has 66mW power consumption and a measurement interval of 1s. (max).
